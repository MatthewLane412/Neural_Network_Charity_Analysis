# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

This anlaysis was completed with neural network libraries such as Tensorflow in Python Jupyter Notebooks. This is another type of machine learning to predict outcomes. In this case, we were predicting if a loan would be successful. Some of the methods we used were training and splitting the data, using pandas dataframes and using the StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder.

## Summary
In conclusion python is a great language for machine learning. The tensorflow library makes machine coding much easier with many of the functions prebuild, only needing information plugged in. When machine learning, the best outcome isn't going to happen on the first try. Practicing with the information in plugging in differet values helps get the best machine learning outcome. Sometimes different layers need to be added or deleted, sometimes columns need to be dropped, other times additoinal epochs should be added. It all depends what data we are working with and getting the most out of our data without overfitting.
